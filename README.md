# Pollinator datasets and metadata descriptions

This repository contains the files used either in the process of searching pollinators, or the list of pollinators themselves. This repository does not contain the scripts used to merge the pollinators here with the PREDICTS database (for that script please see here https://github.com/Joemillard/Global_effects_of_land-use_intensity_on_local_pollinator-biodiversity/blob/main/R/01_PREDICTS_compilation.R), or data for the pollinator expert check (note that this was carried out on the PREDICTS subset alone). For the set of taxa that were either removed or added following the expert check please see Supplementary Data 1 in the Nat Comms paper, or in lines 167-190 of the above script. 

There are four key files in this repository:

1. 'global_polllinating_confirmation_manual-edit.csv' is the original direct evidence csv aggregated from the output of the Ecography paper (i.e. any animal genus found in a pollination related abstract), editing following my initial check of abstracts.
2. clade_extrapolation_2.csv
3. clade_extrapolation_non_text-analysis.csv
4. non_family-genus_species-list.csv

Supplementary Data 2 of the Nat Comms paper contains a list of references used in
