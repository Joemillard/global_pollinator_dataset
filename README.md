# A global dataset of likely animal pollinators

This repository contains the files used in the process of searching pollinators, the groups of pollinators themselves, and a list of likely pollinating species names. Note that these datasets should not be treated as an exclusive list of all pollinators at species level. Instead these data should be merged with taxonomic lists (here either PREDICTS or the Catalogue of Life) to generate species lists of pollinators.

To generate the set of all likely pollinating species in the Catalogue of Life (COL), see this script here https://github.com/Joemillard/Global_effects_of_land-use_intensity_on_local_pollinator-biodiversity/blob/main/R/01c_COL_compilation.R, and the COL here https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/download. When merging with the COL be wary of duplicating species names, and the new version of the COL will need cleaning up with something like this script here (https://github.com/Joemillard/pollinator_taxonomic_geographic_dist_text-analysis/blob/master/R/02.%20clean_catologue-of-life.R). Also note that since the COL subset was not carried out in conjunction with an expert check, this set of species should not be taken at face value. Only the PREDICTS subset was manually checked by a set of experts.

This repository does not contain the scripts used to merge the pollinators here with the PREDICTS database (for that script please see here https://github.com/Joemillard/Global_effects_of_land-use_intensity_on_local_pollinator-biodiversity/blob/main/R/01_PREDICTS_compilation.R), or data for the pollinator expert check (note that this was carried out on the PREDICTS subset alone). For the set of taxa that were either removed or added following the expert check please see Supplementary Data 1 in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23228-3, or in lines 167-190 of the above PREDICTS script. The Nat Comms paper also contains a set of references used in my extrapolation process of pollination.
