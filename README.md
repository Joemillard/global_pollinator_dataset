# A global dataset of likely animal pollinators

This repository contains a set of input files for generating a set of likely animal pollinators in either the PREDICTS database or some set of taxonomic data (e.g. the Catalogue of Life). Each of the input files is the result of a search process for animal pollinators documented in Millard et al (2021) (see metadata for a description of these files). The two output files here are generated by merging each of the inputs (in a particular order according to pollination confidence) with either the PREDICTS database or the Catalogue of Life (i.e. they generate a set of likely pollinators in either of these datasets). Note also that the PREDICTS subset code included here removes a set of species that were deemed by experts unlikely to represent pollinators. The Catalogue of Life subset has not been checked in this manner meaning it should be treated with caution.

It's important to note that the input files should not be treated as an exclusive list of all pollinators at species level. Thse input files are intended only for merged with taxonomic lists to generate species lists of pollinators.

- To generate the set of likely pollinators in the PREDICTS database run this script https://github.com/Joemillard/Global_effects_of_land-use_intensity_on_local_pollinator-biodiversity/blob/main/R/01_PREDICTS_compilation.R), or data for the pollinator expert check (note that this was carried out on the PREDICTS subset alone). For the set of taxa that were either removed or added following the expert check please see lines 167-190 of the above PREDICTS script (also see Supplementary Data 1 in Millard et al. 2021 for the set of taxa removed, and for the set of references used in my extrapolation of likely animal pollination).

- To generate the set of likely pollinating species in the Catalogue of Life (COL) run this script https://github.com/Joemillard/Global_effects_of_land-use_intensity_on_local_pollinator-biodiversity/blob/main/R/01c_COL_compilation.R. For this script you will need to have downloaded a copy of the COL from here https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/download. Note that the 2017 COL will require cleaning up with a script such as this https://github.com/Joemillard/pollinator_taxonomic_geographic_dist_text-analysis/blob/master/R/02.%20clean_catologue-of-life.R). When merging with the COL it's important to be wary of duplicating species names.
