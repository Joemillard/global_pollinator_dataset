# A global dataset of likely animal pollinators

This repository contains a set of input files for generating a set of likely animal pollinators in either the PREDICTS database or some set of taxonomic data (e.g. the Catalogue of Life). Each of the input files is the result of a search process for animal pollinators documented in Millard et al (2021) (see metadata for a description of these files). The two output files here are generated by merging each of the inputs (in a particular order according to pollination confidence) with either the PREDICTS database or the Catalogue of Life (i.e. they generate a set of likely pollinators in either of these datasets). Note also that the PREDICTS subset code included here removes a set of species that were deemed by experts unlikely to represent pollinators. The Catalogue of Life subset has not been checked in this manner meaning it should be treated with caution.

It's important to note that the input files should not be treated as an exclusive list of all pollinators at species level. Thse input files are intended only for merged with taxonomic lists to generate species lists of pollinators.

To generate the set of all likely pollinating species in the Catalogue of Life (COL), see this script here https://github.com/Joemillard/Global_effects_of_land-use_intensity_on_local_pollinator-biodiversity/blob/main/R/01c_COL_compilation.R, and the COL here https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/download. When merging with the COL be wary of duplicating species names, and the new version of the COL will need cleaning up with something like this script here (https://github.com/Joemillard/pollinator_taxonomic_geographic_dist_text-analysis/blob/master/R/02.%20clean_catologue-of-life.R). Also note that since the COL subset was not carried out in conjunction with an expert check, this set of species should not be taken at face value. Only the PREDICTS subset was manually checked by a set of experts.

This repository does not contain the scripts used to merge the pollinators here with the PREDICTS database (for that script please see here https://github.com/Joemillard/Global_effects_of_land-use_intensity_on_local_pollinator-biodiversity/blob/main/R/01_PREDICTS_compilation.R), or data for the pollinator expert check (note that this was carried out on the PREDICTS subset alone). For the set of taxa that were either removed or added following the expert check please see Supplementary Data 1 in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23228-3, or in lines 167-190 of the above PREDICTS script. The Nat Comms paper also contains a set of references used in my extrapolation process of pollination.
